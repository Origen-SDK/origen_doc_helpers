# Yammer Widgets

These helpers wrap the [Yammer Embed API](https://developer.yammer.com/connect/)
which allows Yammer feeds to be embedded in any web page.

The most useful application of this is to provide a comment stream which will be
unique to each page, like the one you see below!

To include comments simply add this to the bottom of any given page, or your
layout file to add comments to every page:

~~~eruby
<%= "<" + "%= yammer_comments %" + ">" %>
~~~

The following options are available:

~~~text
:prompt   - Set what the prompt for new comments should be, 'Comment on this page' is the default
:group_id - Specify a specific Yammer group ID, defaults to config.yammer_group in the application config, and if not defined falls back to the
            Origen User's Group
~~~

<%= yammer_comments %>

% end
