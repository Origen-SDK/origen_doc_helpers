# Disqus Comments

These helpers make it easy to drop a [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments section at the
bottom of your pages, just like [the one below](<%= path "examples/disqus/#Comments" %>).

Note that such comments will be externally visible and therefore **this should not be used for
company internal applications/web pages**. For similar functionality within a company you
can use [Yammer comments](<%= path "examples/yammer" %>) instead if your company uses the
Office 365 suite.

## Community Selection

Any comments made on a web page will be associated with a specific community on Disqus where
they can be collectively viewed and moderated, for example here is
[the Origen SDK Disqus community](https://disqus.com/home/forum/origen-sdk/).

If your web page is about a plugin/application that will be of general interest within the Origen
community, then you are welcome to use the Origen SDK Disqus community which will be selected
by default.

If your pages are more about your specific application domain, then you should
[create you own community channel](https://disqus.com/home/channels/new/) instead.

Your new community can be associated with your application by setting the following
app configuration attribute:

~~~ruby
# config/application.rb
config.disqus_shortname = "my-community"
~~~

Alternatively this parameter can be passed directly to the comments helper as shown
below.

## Adding Comments

To include disqus comments simply add this to the bottom of any given page, or your
layout file to add comments to every page:

~~~eruby
<%= "<" + "%= disqus_comments %" + ">" %>
~~~

The following options are available:

~~~text
:disqus_shortname - Specify the disqus forum to associate your comments with. This will fall back to the value returned by
                    RGen.app.config.disqus_shortname, and failing that will fall back to 'origen-sdk' to select the Origen
                    community channel.
~~~
